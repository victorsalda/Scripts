#Overview.
####This is the report of the second part of the Statistical Inference Peer Assignment:
#Basic inferential data analysis. It includes supporting material such as the codes and 
#figures.

#1. Load packages.
#Let's load the packages we need. If you haven't download them do it first
library("ggplot2")
library("knitr")
library("datasets")
library("ggplot2")
library("ggpmisc")
library("gridExtra")
library("plyr")

#2. Reproducibility.
# Set the seed (55) for reproducibility, i.e., make available to others the data to verify
#the calculations made with the code. 
set.seed(55)

#3. Load the data.
##The data we are going to use in this part of the assignment is the ToothGrowth dataset from R.
#This dataset contains 60 observations of "the Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth 
#in Guinea Pigs". There are three variables: 
#1) Len (Tooth Length, numeric).
#2) Supp (Supplement Type, OJ = orange juice, VC = vitamin C, factor).
#3) Dose (Dose levels of vitamin 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day, numeric).
data("ToothGrowth")
df<-ToothGrowth

#4. Basic summary of the data.
#Let's summarize and do some tables and quick plots with cluster to explore the data. 
summary(df)
table(df$supp, df$dose)

#5. Confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests.
#Let's calculate the confidence intervals (ci) for the mean len of the sample with a confidence
#level of 95%
ci<-mean(ToothGrowth$len) + c(-1, 1) * 1.96 * sd(ToothGrowth$len)/sqrt(nrow(ToothGrowth))

#The "ci" conatis the intervals for all the 60 observation of the ToothGrowth dataset. Now,
#let's get the values by supplement type and dose (means).

#Let's calculate some clusters to do a better interpretation of the intervals.

#Let's add the regression line formula and the value of R^2 in every plot (facet). 
#The basic idea is to create a function (reg_func) whose argument is the data frame with the 
#data (dataframe). Inside this function is created another function with the model of the 
#regression in these case a linear model with a straight line. From this 
#function that was created inside the coefficients and R^2 are obtained.
regression=function(df){
        #setting the regression function. 
        reg_fun<-lm(formula=df$len~df$dose) #regression function
        #getting the slope, intercept, R square and adjusted R squared of 
        #the regression function (with 3 decimals).
        slope<-round(coef(reg_fun)[2],3)

#Let's consider dose and supp at the same time. Let's suppose len (Tooth Length) is normal distributed. So, no matter the 
#sample size the distribution of the sample mean is normally distributed, as well. Let's also assume that the 60 observations are 
#independent. Now, let's also suppose that the sample have been divided randomly in two groups of 30 individuals. One of these groups 
#(OJ or VC). We can consider that the two groups are sample from two different population, and let suppose these two population have the 
#same variance. 

#Therefore, we have two samples of 30 observations each from two population with the len variable is normally distributed and 
#not have the same variance. Now we want to evaluate is the difference in the mean of the len in both group is just by chance or 
#depends on the supplement and dose. So, the null hypothesis we want to contrast is that the mean difference between the two 
#is zero (0). Let's do this contrast first with all doses together and then by dose. In any case, with a 95% confidence levels,
#so that we have only a 5% chance of making a Type I error.
